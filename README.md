### Useful table for Types vs Interfaces

It's a nuanced topic, don't get too hung up on it. Here's a handy table:

| Aspect                                          | Type | Interface |
| ----------------------------------------------- | :--: | :-------: |
| Can describe functions                          |  ✅  |    ✅     |
| Can describe constructors                       |  ✅  |    ✅     |
| Can describe tuples                             |  ✅  |    ✅     |
| Interfaces can extend it                        |  ⚠️  |    ✅     |
| Classes can extend it                           |  🚫  |    ✅     |
| Classes can implement it (`implements`)         |  ⚠️  |    ✅     |
| Can intersect another one of its kind           |  ✅  |    ⚠️     |
| Can create a union with another one of its kind |  ✅  |    🚫     |
| Can be used to create mapped types              |  ✅  |    🚫     |
| Can be mapped over with mapped types            |  ✅  |    ✅     |
| Expands in error messages and logs              |  ✅  |    🚫     |
| Can be augmented                                |  🚫  |    ✅     |
| Can be recursive                                |  ⚠️  |    ✅     |
